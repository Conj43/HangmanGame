This is a simple Hangman Game I made in C. I made this project when C was the only language I really knew how to use. It is pretty simple, and generates words randomly from a pool 
of randomly generated words. I used ChatGPT to randomly generate the words, and even told it how to format them so I could simply just copy and paste it into my code.
